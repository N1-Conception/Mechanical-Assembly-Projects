# Mini Bench Vice Assembly

This project showcases a *Mini Bench Vice Assembly* modeled using SolidWorks. It includes all individual parts assembled into a functional unit, designed for gripping objects firmly during work processes like filing, drilling, or cutting.

## Features

- Fully assembled bench vice

- Realistic dimensions and constraints

- Suitable for educational and demonstration purposes

- Created in SolidWorks with proper mates and movements
