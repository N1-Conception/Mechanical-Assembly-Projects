# Assembly-Model-1-SW

This repository contains a SolidWorks 3D model of a Pulley Bracket Assembly â€” a mechanical fixture designed to support and guide a pulley wheel mounted on a fixed base. This assembly demonstrates key mechanical design principles, including fastener use, part alignment, and rotational freedom for belt or rope drives.

## Features

- *Base Plate*: Provides a stable mounting platform for the assembly.
- *Side Brackets*: Rigid vertical supports to hold the pulley axle.
- *Pulley Wheel*: Allows smooth rotation for transmission of force via belt or rope.
- *Fasteners*: Hex bolts and nuts used for assembly integrity and modularity.

## Applications

- Belt-driven mechanical systems
- Educational mechanical design models
- Demonstration of bracket and pulley mounting techniques
