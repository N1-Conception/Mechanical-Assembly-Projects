# Ball Bearing | SolidWorks Design

A precise 3D model of a *Ball Bearing*, designed in SolidWorks, showcasing the essential mechanical component widely used to reduce rotational friction and support radial and axial loads.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features

- Detailed modeling of *inner ring, **outer ring, **balls, and **cage (retainer)*

- Suitable for demonstrating basic bearing assembly and mechanical applications

- Designed with real-world proportions for educational and prototyping use




## âš™ Application Overview


Ball bearings are fundamental machine elements used to:

- Reduce friction between moving parts

- Support radial and axial loads in rotating machinery

- Improve efficiency in mechanical systems like motors, gearboxes, and turbines

## ðŸ›  Components Modeled
